Elihu Vedder, an American artist (1836-1923) painted a series of five paintings depicting a fisherman saving a mermaid from a net in the sea. He had 5 different paintings in this series that were all related to the world undersea [^3].This is an Oil on canvas piece created from 1888-1889. Vedder was an American artist, however he lived in Italy while he painted this series; therefore, there is much mythological and cultural influence from Italy [^1] found in this collection.

#The Fisherman and The Mermaid: Annotations
The last of a five painting series, *The Fisherman and The Mermaid* by Elihu Vedder, focuses on the relationship between women of the sea, and the men who sail it [^2]. He was inspired by many authors and artists who, at the time, were giving the mermaid trope its spotlight. Typically, mermaids were depitced in two different lights. In this piece by Vedder, there are several elements of both realism both in a literal sense, and in the context of his society.

#Comparative Visuals

#The Sirens: Gustave Moreau
This piece was created by Gustave Moreau, it is called *The Sirens*. In this work, Moreau depicts sirens looking over the sea. This ties into the evaluation of how women of the sea were portrayed through art. Here, the three sirens are very natural and have a sense of soft beauty to them. This juxtaposes Vedder's piece because he chose to depict the mermaid as a more cunning and devilish figure. Even though the mermaids here are seen naked, they are not depicted in a tempting sexual nature, rather they are respresentative of the antural state of the earth.

#Two Knights and Two Sirens: Raphael Drouart
This piece was created by Raphael Drouart, a French artist. This piece depicts two knights in their armor, presumably at war, and two mermaid-like women in the water below them. Here, these women of the sea are depicted as more of a temptress. The sirens are posed suggestively without clothing and look as if they are trying to entice the knights. This trope is more in line with what Vedder was trying to depict in his painting.

#Mermaids: Ludovico Sardagna
The piece was created by Italian artist, Ludovico Sardagna. This piece shows five different mermaid-like creatures in the water. Here, they are more child-like, yet still have distinct female features. This is a completely different representation of mermaids than have been evaluated thus far. Instead of being temptresses or soft nurturing figures, Sardagna chose to make them more childish and dynamic.

#Additional Information
Below are ten resources of additional information about the artists being compared to the original artwork by ==Elihu Vedder=={Q389726}. The works I will be comparing are by ==Gustave Moreau=={Q203828} and ==Raphael Drouart=={Q21289707}. Amongst the information about each artist compared here, there are multiple resources about certain tropes, such as ==Sirens=={Q150986}, or Mermaids, and the Femme Fatale and how they developed and influenced art and culture. Another factor important to my evaluation is ==The Little Mermaid=={Q11859} by Hans Christian Andersen. This book ushered in a new infactuation with mermaids within literature and art. In the article, [Hans Christian Anderson and Disney: The Tale of Two Different Mermaids](https://crosssection.gns.wisc.edu/2017/09/06/hans-christian-andersen-and-disney-the-tale-of-two-different-mermaids/), Hans Christian Anderson's version of The Little Mermaid and Disney's adaptation are compared to see how the portrayal of the mermaid herself was changed, as well as some more raw parts of the story [^4]. Many sources point out that  sirens have been portrayed throughout history in human culture for a very long time. In [Siren Song: History of Mermaids in Art](https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/mermaids-in-art/), [An Alluring, Deadly Song- The History of Mermaids in Art](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/mermaids-in-art), the longstanding tropes of seductive and powerful siren have evolved. Culture has since taken the siren trope and transformed it into a general trope for many female characters to adopt. This trait can be categorized as a Femme Fatale. In [Artistic Portrayals of the Femme Fatale](https://victorianweb.org/gender/fatalart.html) and [Femme Fatales The rise, fall, and rebirth, of an archetype](https://www.arthistoryproject.com/subjects/people/femme-fatales/), the impact of the Femme Fatale can be traced to the seductive and mechievious portrayal in the past of female sirens and their relationship towards sailors. However, not all mermaids and femal characters have fallen into this trope [^5].
