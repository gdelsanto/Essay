Elihu Vedder, an American artist (1836-1923) painted a series of five paintings depicting a fisherman saving a mermaid from a net in the sea. This is an Oil on canvas piece created from 1888-1889. Vedder was an American artist, however he lived in Italy while he painted this series; therefore, there is much mythological and cultural influence from Italy found in this collection.

#The Fisherman and The Mermaid: Annotations
The last of a five painting series, *The Fisherman and The Mermaid* by Elihu Vedder, focuses on the relationship between women of the sea, and the men who sail it. He was inspired by many authors and artists who, at the time, were giving the mermaid trope its spotlight. Typically, mermaids were depitced in two different lights. In this piece by Vedder, there are several elements of both realism both in a literal sense, and in the context of his society.

#Comparative Visuals

#The Sirens: Gustave Moreau
This piece was created by Gustave Moreau, it is called *The Sirens*. In this work, Moreau depicts sirens looking over the sea. This ties into the evaluation of how women of the sea were portrayed through art. Here, the three sirens are very natural and have a sense of soft beauty to them. This juxtaposes Vedder's piece because he chose to depict the mermaid as a more cunning and devilish figure. Even though the mermaids here are seen naked, they are not depicted in a tempting sexual nature, rather they are respresentative of the antural state of the earth.

#Two Knights and Two Sirens: Raphael Drouart
This piece was created by Raphael Drouart, a French artist. This piece depicts two knights in their armor, presumably at war, and two mermaid-like women in the water below them. Here, these women of the sea are depicted as more of a temptress. The sirens are posed suggestively without clothing and look as if they are trying to entice the knights. This trope is more in line with what Vedder was trying to depict in his painting.

#Mermaids: Ludovico Sardagna
The piece was created by Italian artist, Ludovico Sardagna. This piece shows five different mermaid-like creatures in the water. Here, they are more child-like, yet still have distinct female features. This is a completely different representation of mermaids than have been evaluated thus far. Instead of being temptresses or soft nurturing figures, Sardagna chose to make them more childish and dynamic.
